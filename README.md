NOTE:

1. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE FOR ALL ASSIGNMENTS.

2. YOU WILL GET CAUGHT EVEN IF YOU COPY AND PASTE WITHOUT COMMITING TO UNI ADELAIDE SVN WEB SUB SYSTEM.

3. THE MAKE FILE WRITTEN WILL AUTOMATICALLY KEEP A COPY OF YOUR CODE IN THE BACKGROUND EVERY TIME YOU RUN MAKE.

4. THE PLAGIARISM CHECKER DOES NOT ONLY CHECK CODE THAT YOU SUBMITTED BUT IT CHECKS ALL THE CODE THAT YOU RUN "MAKE" WITH ON YOUR MACHINE.

5. AGAIN, JUST LOOK AT THE LOGIC BUT THE QUESTIONS AND COMPONENTS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SEMESTER, SO IF YOU SUBMITTED MY CODE, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GET CAUGHT. I PROMISE.

6. DISCLAIMER: MY CODE DID NOT PASS 100% OF THE TEST CASES, THEY FAIL SOME OF THE HIDDEN AND NON HIDDEN TEST CASES.
